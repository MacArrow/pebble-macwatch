MacWatch is a simple watch based on simplicity and weather examples from Pebble SDK

Currently it is doing the following:

- shows date and time
- inverts screen after sunset
- shows battery status
- shows connection status
    - it would vibrate twice when connection is lost
- shows current temperature and air pressure for the current location
- shows next day forecast for the current location
